HAL9000 is a chatbot for platforms like Skype and Facebook Messenger that retrieves the prices of items from E-commerce websites.

Currently implemented only for amazon.in, we intend to add more websites to the bots capabilities.
It uses the Amazon Product Advertisement API to retrieve information from the site, and displays a list of options.

The response from the bot includes the product URL, price and item name.
The user prompt is through input like "Price of an iPhone", "trimmer price", "What's the price of a JBL speaker?", and "how much do alarm clocks cost?"

Intended future feature additions include:
	Adding a tracking feature that lets you know when the price of an item drops
	More websites to find results from
	Buying the products through the bot itself, using the website's authentication and log in credentials
